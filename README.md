I am trying to learn how to use GitHub with VS Code, and also relearn flask!
using this tutorial: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
So I don't forget, this is what I am doing to set up my virtual environment:
1. Via Terminal, navigate to the folder for this project (microblog)
2. Set up the virtual environment with the command: virtualenv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Flask: pip install flask
If I ever need to deactivate the virtual environment, the command deactivate works.
